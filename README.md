#### What this isn't?
- The best way to implement a solution to this especific problem.
- A program to solve any generic eletromagnect problem using moment methods. 

## Dependencies

- Numpy
- Mpl_toolkits
- Python3

## Usage

```python
python3 MomentMethods.py L V0 N [-q [-nplot]]
```

- `L` : The length of the metal plate.
- `V0` : The tension applied on the metla plate.
- `N` : The number of subdivisions on moment methods.
- `-q` : Optional. Prints the total charge if specified.
- `-nplot` : Optional. If especified with the `-q` arg the program will do the calculations but won't print the graphic.
